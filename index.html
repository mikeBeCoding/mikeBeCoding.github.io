                    <p> <i>&ldquo; <strong><span style="color:#065270;">Technology</span></strong> has always been a massive part of my life. In my younger years, my family &amp; friends would ask
                         if I could take a look at their gadgets to see if I could fix a problem they were having; most of the time, the solution came to me quickly. I would find joy in soft-modding consoles
                          (Nintendo Wii &amp; X-Box) or jailbreaking iPhones. The more challenging the task, the more interested I was in figuring it out! I was the <strong>&ldquo;<span style="color:#065270;">self-proclaimed</span>&rdquo;</strong> tech guy.
                           Another hobby of mine was playing video games. My favorites were Street Fighter, Call of Duty, Rock Band, and anything Mario. Still, puzzle games like Tetris, Hexic, and Quantum Conundrum have always sparked my interest. Puzzles games are so mentally stimulating!
                            What made me look into becoming a Web Developer/Software Engineer was the never-ending challenges you encounter. So, in my opinion, I believe programming is a puzzle. With its many languages, frameworks, and libraries, it feels like you're connecting piece by piece,
                             creating things you thought weren't imaginable! It's a skill you can't even imagine mastering! I'm <strong><span style="color:#065270;">very passionate</span></strong> about what I do and I'm ready to share my newfound skills. &rdquo;
